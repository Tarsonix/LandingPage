Whether you're looking to streamline your marketing operations, enhance your customer support systems, or optimize your data management processes, n8n provides the flexibility and extensibility needed to create powerful automation workflows.</p>
      
      <p>Unlike many other automation platforms, n8n can be self-hosted, giving you full control over your data and workflows. It also offers a wide range of integrations with popular services and applications, making it a versatile choice for organizations of all sizes.</p>
      
      <h2>Getting Started with n8n</h2>
      <p>Setting up n8n is straightforward. You can either use the cloud version or self-host it using Docker, npm, or other installation methods. Once installed, you'll have access to a visual workflow editor where you can create, test, and deploy your automation workflows.</p>
      
      <div class="code-block-container">
        <pre><code>
# Install n8n globally using npm
npm install n8n -g

# Start n8n
n8n
        </code></pre>

      <p>After starting n8n, you can access the editor through your web browser and begin creating workflows. The interface is intuitive, allowing you to drag and drop nodes, configure settings, and test your workflows in real-time.</p>
      
      <h2>Building Your First Workflow</h2>
      <p>Let's create a simple workflow that monitors a specific hashtag on Twitter, saves the tweets to a Google Sheet, and sends you a notification when new tweets are found.</p>
      
      <h3>Step 1: Set Up the Trigger</h3>
      <p>In n8n, triggers are the starting points of workflows. For this example, we'll use the Twitter trigger node to monitor tweets with a specific hashtag.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Add a Twitter trigger node to your workflow</li>
        <li>Configure it to search for tweets containing your target hashtag (e.g., #AIAutomation)</li>
        <li>Set the polling interval to determine how often it checks for new tweets</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 2: Process the Data</h3>
      <p>Next, we'll add a Function node to process the tweet data before saving it to a Google Sheet.</p>
      
      <div class="code-block-container">
        <pre><code>
// This function extracts relevant information from tweets
return items.map(item => {
  return {
    json: {
      tweetId: item.json.id_str,
      username: item.json.user.screen_name,
      text: item.json.full_text || item.json.text,
      timestamp: item.json.created_at,
      hashtags: item.json.entities.hashtags.map(tag => tag.text).join(', ')
    }
  };
});
        </code></pre>
      </div>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Save to Google Sheets</h3>
      <p>Now, we'll add a Google Sheets node to save the processed tweet data.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Add a Google Sheets node to your workflow</li>
        <li>Connect your Google account</li>
        <li>Select or create a spreadsheet and worksheet</li>
        <li>Configure the node to append the processed tweet data to the sheet</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 4: Send a Notification</h3>
      <p>Finally, we'll add a Slack node to send a notification when new tweets are found.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Add a Slack node to your workflow</li>
        <li>Connect your Slack account</li>
        <li>Configure the node to send a message to your desired channel</li>
